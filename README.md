# Notemap

Notemap is a Markdown-like, simple markup language that can be used to quickly generate [mindmap-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) diagrams from a human-readable (and writable) plain text file. Its intended use is as a concise, structured, quick-to-write format for notetaking and project planning.

## Schema

Notemaps are made up of `nodes`, and all notemaps start with a root node, which represents the object or category of information the notemap represents.

`put example notemap with single root node here later`

Child nodes branch from there, and represent a sub-concept or subsection of the child node's parent.

`example notemap with root and three children, it's a tree diagram it's not hard`

`put more summary of the format here after implementation is done, things will likely change a bit during development`

### Nodes

All nodes have a **title** and **body**. The **title** is the label that will be shown on the node when it's rendered into a visual diagram.
